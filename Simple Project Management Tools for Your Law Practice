			Simple Project Management Tools for Your Law Practice
		</h2>
		<p>
			In the ongoing discussion about the future of the legal profession, some have argued that lawyers are destined to become project managers. While that may or may not prove to be true, lawyers certainly can learn from today's project managers, and even borrow some of their tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			One such tool is Basecamp, a popular web-based project management platform developed nearly a decade ago by 37signals and updated considerably in 2012. Basecamp's interface revolves around "Projects," distinct collections of to-do lists, calendars, document libraries, and discussion boards. Multiple users within a firm or organization can be assigned to a project and access a shared set of project management resources through the collaborative Basecamp tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you aren't ready for a comprehensive project management tool, a host of good options are available to assist with discrete elements of project management.
		</p>
		<p>
			To understand how Basecamp and other project management tools can be used in your practice, consider typical problems they can solve.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Problem 1: Scattered To-Do Lists, Missing Tasks, and Duplicated Efforts
		</h3>
		<p>
			Virtually everyone uses to-do lists, and we all seem to have our own to-do methodology. For some, that means entering everything into an Outlook calendar, for others it's dedicated task management software, or in many cases, it's simply a matter of scribbling lists on scraps of paper strewn about our desks.
		</p>
		<p>
			These scattered task lists can be problematic, however, when multiple people are involved in the same matter or project. All too often we assume that a colleague is handling a task only to discover that they assumed the same-and the task was neglected. In other cases, multiple people work on the same task separately, leading to needless duplication.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basecamp can help minimize these situations by centralizing to-do lists for each project. The "To-Do" area of each project in Basecamp supports multiple separate lists. In a legal practice, this might be used to set up lists based on the stage of a matter (e.g. client intake, billing, closing a matter, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			Tasks can be rearranged or moved from list to list with simple drag-and-drop functionality. Taking the to-do list a step further, Basecamp allows users to assign tasks and to set deadlines. This helps ensure that tasks are done in a timely manner and avoids wasteful duplication. As an added benefit, users can easily view tasks based on the person they're assigned to or by the due date, allowing a user to see all tasks assigned to them personally, or allowing a project administrator to keep a close eye on what tasks are overdue.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're looking for better task management without the full commitment of Basecamp, two popular options are Remember the Milk and Wunderlist. Remember the Milk (often referred to simply as RTM) allows users to create and share task lists with a simple, no-frills interface. Wunderlist offers a more polished interface, but its sharing features are less robust and may be better suited to solo practitioners.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Problem 2: Over, Under and Miscommunication
		</h3>
		<p>
			Technology has given us numerous ways to communicate, but this can be as much a curse as a blessing. When communication about a project begins to proliferate among email, voicemail, texts, the firm intranet, handwritten notes and face-to-face conversations, it's inevitable that some important communications will be lost, or at least not shared as widely as they should be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basecamp helps address this problem because it's fundamentally a collaborative project management tool designed to engage an entire team. The two key features in this case: discussions and comment fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basecamp's discussion feature allows users on the project to hold ongoing threaded discussions. The project administrator might use this area to post a brief introduction to the project, for example, or a user might post general updates about their recent work on the project. The feature is entirely open- ended: whatever conversations you normally have about a matter via email can take place here.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to this dedicated discussions area, Basecamp allows users to comment on almost every type of content added to a project. If a user had a question or comment about a specific item on a to-do list, for example, they need only click on that to-do and fill out a simple comment form. Users can even attach files to a comment.
		</p>
		<p>
			And while these communication tools serve as an excellent replacement for email and other communication methods, they don't prevent users from continuing to use email. Indeed, the system is designed to integrate closely with email. When you create a discussion or leave a comment, you have the option to notify other members of the project via email. They can, in turn, respond to your update via email and their response will be added to Basecamp in the appropriate location.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each project is also assigned a unique email address, and users can send content into Basecamp - including discussions, files, and to-do items - simply by emailing them to that designated address. If you'd prefer to test the waters with a tool more exclusively geared toward communication, two alternatives include Sendgine and Yammer. Sendgine, which has its origin in a previous communication tool called Dialawg, allows users to hold secure electronic conversations with several added features, like document sharing and limited task management. Yammer, which was recently acquired by Microsoft, allows users to communicate in a style reminiscent of Twitter or Facebook, but with a variety of added business features.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Problem 3: Arcane Filing Systems and the Curse of Inbox Collaboration
		</h3>
		<p>
			It's difficult to conceive of a legal project that doesn't involve the exchange or creation of some documents. Indeed, for most firms, managing documents and electronic files is a major day-to-day operation.
		</p>
		<p>
			But in our connected and collaborative modern world, exchanging and managing documents can be frustrating. Documents are regularly caught in email loops with revisions being made left-and-right, leaving everyone unsure as to who has the most recent version. One lawyer may save their files to a common file server while another saves them locally, and a third keeps them mostly in email.
		</p>
		<p>
			Managing a firm's documents is a major undertaking and one that, depending on the practice, may be best suited to a dedicated document management system. But for lighter duty, particularly relating to an ongoing project, Basecamp's support for file uploads can be a tremendous benefit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basecamp users have the ability to upload documents directly to a file library dedicated exclusively to that project, or as discussed above, they can link uploaded documents to comments and discussions. Not only does this centralize the files related to a matter or project, it also links the file directly to a specific moment in time. In other words, you won't just have a copy of an old contract saved in a folder, you'll have a clear record of why that contract was requested, who submitted it, and when. For discrete tools, the communication platforms discussed above will offer limited document functionality that may be sufficient in some situations. If you'd like to go further, consider a document management tool like Box that offers robust collaborative features (e.g. sharing, comments).
		</p>
		<h3>
			Problem 4: Knowledge Rot and Forgetting What We've Learned or Done
		</h3>
		<p>
			In the course of a project, case or matter, we usually learn a considerable amount. We learn information about the client and their needs. We learn about best practices and how to tackle complicated issues. We learn about the law. But when we reach the end of the matter, that knowledge begins to deteriorate. A few months or a year later, we may be repeating much of the same work and experiencing old frustrations anew, because we've lost track of what we learned previously. Basecamp helps address this in two ways: searchability and preservation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Searching for a particular bit of information or a specific file related to a matter is usually a nightmare. To search thoroughly, you often need to search through separate email, file servers, individual computers, and paper files. The process is time consuming, inefficient, and often inaccurate. By centralizing much of this information in one place through Basecamp, however, search becomes dramatically easier. A simple search of Basecamp will simultaneously look at documents, tasks, discussions, and files.
		</p>
		<p>
			Second, Basecamp allows users to archive completed projects. Archiving allows users to retain important work product indefinitely, reactivating and retrieving it only if it becomes necessary at some point in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			It will be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate the matter-wide search ability of a comprehensive tool like Basecamp when using separate products. That said, tools like PBworks—essentially a private Wiki or Intranet—may do the trick. If choosing to use separate products, be sure you adopt best practices like following consistent file naming conventions, using standard matter numbers, and so forth.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Problem 5: When Software and Business Practices Collide
		</h3>
		<p>
			Most lawyers subscribe wholeheartedly to the old adage "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" - and with good reason. Delivering quality counsel while adhering to strict professional conduct standards can be challenging, and once a firm has found the right balance it's difficult to justify change. When established business processes run up against new technology, however, the results can be unpleasant. Firms sometimes make large investments in technology they end up underutilizing, or they avoid updating technology entirely and are eventually forced to play catch-up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basecamp is designed to be simple, easy to use and flexible in part so that it will appeal to a variety of businesses, industries and project types. A firm could, for example, make heavy use of the task list and communication tools while leaving document management to an existing document management system. Alternatively, a firm could piece together a solution using the type of project management tools discussed above.
		</p>
		<p>
			Firms should be open to evolving their business processes, however, as technology evolves. Software like Basecamp and other project management tools include features based on considerable feedback from experienced project management professionals. By approaching new tools with an open mind (and a firm grasp of the Rules of Professional Conduct), firms have the opportunity to get the most out of their technology investments.
