    <h2>Part I. Driving and Being in Actual Physical Control Offenses</h2>

    <h3>Chapter 1. Driving Under the Influence</h3>

    <h4>§ 1:1. Driving under the influence—A brief history</h4>

    <p>Since as early as 1909, it has been illegal to operate a vehicle while intoxicated.[<a href="#a1">1</a>] Driving under the influence became a substantive offense with the Regulation Vehicle Operation Act of 1927, which made it unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug.[<a href="#a2">2</a>] By the 1950s, devices for analyzing breath alcohol concentration, such as Rolla Harger’s Drunkometer, and R. F. Borkenstein’s Breathalyzer were in use.[<a href="#a3">3</a>] At the time, the law provided that the amount of alcohol in the defendant’s blood, as shown by chemical analysis of blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, gave rise to a presumption that the defendant was under the influence if the test indicated a concentration of 0.15 or more.[<a href="#a4">4</a>]</p>

    <p>The per se threshold was lowered to 0.10 by Initiative Measure No. 242 in 1969, which also approved “implied consent,” whereby a driver in this state impliedly consents to breath or blood testing.[<a href="#a4">4</a>] The requirement that the prosecution prove a relationship between blood alcohol (the statutory element) and breath alcohol (the test result) remained in effect until the 1986 Legislature redefined the per se offense in terms of breath alcohol, rendering proof of the relationship between breath alcohol and blood alcohol unnecessary.[<a href="#a6">6</a>] Effective January 1, 1999, the Legislature lowered the threshold to the current level of 0.08.[<a href="#a7">7</a>]</p>

    <p>On November 6, 2012, voters passed Initiative Measure No. 502, which took effect, in part, on December 6, 2012, 30 days after the general election.[<a href="#a8">8</a>] The measure provided for licensing and regulation of marijuana production, distribution and possession for persons 21 and older; removed Washington State criminal penalties and civil penalties for activities the measure authorized; taxed marijuana sales and earmarked marijuana-related revenues for purposes including substance-abuse prevention, research, education and healthcare, and finally, imposed the maximum threshold for THC blood concentration in drivers 21 and older at 5.00 nanograms per milliliter of blood.[<a href="#a9">9</a>]</p>

    <p>Initiative Measure 502 defines “THC concentration” as “nanograms of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of a person’s whole blood” but excludes measurement of the inactive “metabolite THC-COOH, also known as carboxy-THC.”[<a href="#a10">10</a>] Marijuana is still listed as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, thus, growing, distributing and possessing marijuana is a violation of federal law, regardless of whether state laws permit such activities.[<a href="#a11">11</a>] Mere possession of marijuana is also an offense under federal law, where a first offender is subject to a maximum of 1 year of imprisonment, and a minimum fine of $1,000, or both.[<a href="#a12">12</a>]</p>

    <p>On April 17, 2013, the United States Supreme Court published its decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14499014081323626376&amp;q=Missouri+v.+McNeely&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48" open_blank="" title="Google Scholar">Missouri v. McNeely</a>, changing the landscape for blood testing, and potentially, breath testing, under our implied consent laws. The <em>decision held</em> that “[n]atural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream does not present a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s search warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases, and instead, exigency in this context must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstance.”[<a href="#a13">13</a>]</p>

    <p>The 2013 Washington Legislature responded by de-authorizing blood draws under our implied consent law.[<a href="#a14">14</a>] These legislative amendments codify the requirement, effective September 28, 2013, that law enforcement may only obtain blood samples “pursuant to a search warrant, a valid waiver of the warrant requirement, or when exigent circumstances exist.”[<a href="#a15">15</a>] See Chapter 24 for a discussion of implied consent law changes.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1. Driving Under the Influence</h2>

    <h3>§ 1:2. Driving under the influence—Elements</h3>

    <p>In order to convict a person of driving under the influence, the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, on or about a certain date, in the relevant jurisdiction:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
        drove a vehicle within this state while:

        <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none">[<a href="#b1">1</a>]</li>

            <li>the person has, within two hours after driving, an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher, as shown by analysis of the person’s breath or blood made under RCW 46.61.506;<a href="#b2">2</a> or</li>

            <li>the person has, within two hours after driving, a THC concentration of 5.00 or higher as shown by analysis of the person’s blood made under RCW 46.61.506;<a href="#b3">3</a> or</li>

            <li>the person is under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor, marijuana,<a href="#b1">4</a> or any drug; or</li>

            <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p>the person is under the combined influence of, or affected by, intoxicating liquor, marijuana, [<a href="#b5">5</a>] and any drug.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>If the prosecution seeks to convict by means of analysis of a person’s breath or blood, they must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that any breath or blood analysis made is accurate and reliable.[<a href="#b6">6</a>]</p>

    <p>Alcohol concentration means grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of a person’s breath, or grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of a person’s blood.[<a href="#b7">7</a>] “‘THC concentration’ means nanograms of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of a person’s whole blood. THC concentration does not include measurement of the metabolite THC-COOH, also known as carboxy-THC.”[<a href="#b8">8</a>]</p>

    <p>The four means of proving a DUI case are known as the “per se” prongs—a breath or blood concentration of 0.08 or higher of alcohol, or 5.00 nanograms or higher of THC, [<a href="#b9">9</a>] and the “affected by” prongs—proof by means of showing the driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, marijuana, or any drug, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and, marijuana, and any drug, to the point that it affected the person’s driving. [<a href="#b10">10</a>]</p>

    <p>In a case where there is no breath or blood concentration, but there is other evidence of impairment, the prosecution might proceed under the “affected by” prongs of the statute. In a case where there is a test result, and other evidence of impairment, the prosecution might proceed under both prongs.</p>

    <p>In “any case in which the analysis shows an alcohol concentration above 0.00,” the analysis “may be used as evidence that a person was under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor or any drug, in violation of RCW 46.61.502(1)(c) or (d).”<a href="#b11">11</a> Likewise, “in any case where there is an analysis that shows a THC concentration above 0.00,” the analysis “may be used as evidence that a person was under the influence of or affected by marijuana in violation of RCW 46.61.502(1)(c) or (d).”[<a href="#b12">12</a>]</p>

    <p>In Washington, there is no statutorily defined “per se” level of intoxication for any drug, other than THC, as there is with alcohol. Thus, where the allegation is drugged driving, or where the allegation involves a combination of drugs and less than the per se level of alcohol (0.08) or THC (5.00ng), the prosecution can only proceed under what is referred to as the “affected by” prongs. The fact that a person is or has been entitled to use such drug under the laws of this state does not constitute a defense.[<a href="#b13">13</a>] It matters not whether the drug was prescribed, purchased over the counter, or an illegal drug.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence is a fact that also must be found by the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. In Alleyne v. U.S., Mr. Alleyne was charged with an offense that carries a mandatory minimum sentence, which increases depending on certain acts committed during the offense. Before sentencing, upon receiving the presentence report recommending a higher sentence than the mandatory minimum, he objected because the jury verdict form had not indicated that the jury had found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had committed the act necessitating the increased sentence. Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the court, overruling the lower court, holding that “ [b]ecause mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “element” that must be submitted to the jury.”[<a href="#b14">14</a>]</p>
