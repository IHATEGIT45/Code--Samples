        <li>We really don&#39;t have time to get into litigation.If you want your money back you can have it back...but you don&#39;t get to use dubblebooked anymore.</li>

        <li>Yes, we know dubblebooked is spelled incorrectly. We&#39;re cheap and so was the domain.</li>

        <li>The rest of the stuff below is there to waste everyone&#39;s time. If you want to read it, fine. Just don&#39;t expect us to do the same.</li>

        <li>We do not warrant any information or service associated with this site. If you have a problem, the best we can do is refund your money. Basically, we aren&#39;t responsible for anything except refunding your money.</li>
